# LoginWindow
Requires PyQt5 library.

If using PyCharm (like me), just go to File > Settings > Project: [Your Project Name] > Project Interpreter, click the + icon, search for 'PyQt5' and install.

Otherwise, open a command window and enter 'pip install pyqt5' to install the library. You can then run the file from the command line with 'python LoginWindow.py' from the directory that the file is in.
